## Datasets
The datasets are on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M76eI-TsgmfsKsMKTusONNcR_QEqEzdF/view?usp=sharing). This dataset is open source and can be used for scientific publications or academic projects. The datasets contain 2 folders, namely images and annotations. The resolution of the dataset is 512*512 pixel resolutions. There are 3 classes in the dataset, namely cracks, spallings, and voids. Cracks are labelled as RGB(1,1,1), spallings are labelled as RGB(2,2,2), and voids are labelled as RGB(3,3,3). For visualization, an RGB value conversion must be done with the preprocessing.
